CONFIGURATION
=============

You can configure youtube-dl by placing default arguments (such as
--extract-audio --no-mtime to always extract the audio and not copy the
mtime) into /etc/youtube-dl.conf and/or ~/.config/youtube-dl/config. On
Windows, the configuration file locations are
%APPDATA%\youtube-dl\config.txt and C:\Users\<Yourname>\youtube-dl.conf.

OUTPUT TEMPLATE
===============

The -o option allows users to indicate a template for the output file
names. The basic usage is not to set any template arguments when
downloading a single file, like in
youtube-dl -o funny_video.flv "http://some/video". However, it may
contain special sequences that will be replaced when downloading each
video. The special sequences have the format %(NAME)s. To clarify, that
is a percent symbol followed by a name in parenthesis, followed by a
lowercase S. Allowed names are:

-   id: The sequence will be replaced by the video identifier.
-   url: The sequence will be replaced by the video URL.
-   uploader: The sequence will be replaced by the nickname of the
    person who uploaded the video.
-   upload_date: The sequence will be replaced by the upload date in
    YYYYMMDD format.
-   title: The sequence will be replaced by the video title.
-   ext: The sequence will be replaced by the appropriate extension
    (like flv or mp4).
-   epoch: The sequence will be replaced by the Unix epoch when creating
    the file.
-   autonumber: The sequence will be replaced by a five-digit number
    that will be increased with each download, starting at zero.
-   playlist: The name or the id of the playlist that contains the
    video.
-   playlist_index: The index of the video in the playlist, a five-digit
    number.

The current default template is %(title)s-%(id)s.%(ext)s.

In some cases, you don't want special characters such as 中, spaces, or
&, such as when transferring the downloaded filename to a Windows system
or the filename through an 8bit-unsafe channel. In these cases, add the
--restrict-filenames flag to get a shorter title:

    $ youtube-dl --get-filename -o "%(title)s.%(ext)s" BaW_jenozKc
    youtube-dl test video ''_ä↭𝕐.mp4    # All kinds of weird characters
    $ youtube-dl --get-filename -o "%(title)s.%(ext)s" BaW_jenozKc --restrict-filenames
    youtube-dl_test_video_.mp4          # A simple file name

VIDEO SELECTION
===============

Videos can be filtered by their upload date using the options --date,
--datebefore or --dateafter, they accept dates in two formats:

-   Absolute dates: Dates in the format YYYYMMDD.
-   Relative dates: Dates in the format
    (now|today)[+-][0-9](day|week|month|year)(s)?

Examples:

    # Download only the videos uploaded in the last 6 months
    $ youtube-dl --dateafter now-6months

    # Download only the videos uploaded on January 1, 1970
    $ youtube-dl --date 19700101

    $ # will only download the videos uploaded in the 200x decade
    $ youtube-dl --dateafter 20000101 --datebefore 20091231

FAQ
===

Can you please put the -b option back?

Most people asking this question are not aware that youtube-dl now
defaults to downloading the highest available quality as reported by
YouTube, which will be 1080p or 720p in some cases, so you no longer
need the -b option. For some specific videos, maybe YouTube does not
report them to be available in a specific high quality format you're
interested in. In that case, simply request it with the -f option and
youtube-dl will try to download it.

I get HTTP error 402 when trying to download a video. What's this?

Apparently YouTube requires you to pass a CAPTCHA test if you download
too much. We're considering to provide a way to let you solve the
CAPTCHA, but at the moment, your best course of action is pointing a
webbrowser to the youtube URL, solving the CAPTCHA, and restart
youtube-dl.

I have downloaded a video but how can I play it?

Once the video is fully downloaded, use any video player, such as vlc or
mplayer.

The links provided by youtube-dl -g are not working anymore

The URLs youtube-dl outputs require the downloader to have the correct
cookies. Use the --cookies option to write the required cookies into a
file, and advise your downloader to read cookies from that file. Some
sites also require a common user agent to be used, use --dump-user-agent
to see the one in use by youtube-dl.

ERROR: no fmt_url_map or conn information found in video info

youtube has switched to a new video info format in July 2011 which is
not supported by old versions of youtube-dl. You can update youtube-dl
with sudo youtube-dl --update.

ERROR: unable to download video

youtube requires an additional signature since September 2012 which is
not supported by old versions of youtube-dl. You can update youtube-dl
with sudo youtube-dl --update.

SyntaxError: Non-ASCII character

The error

    File "youtube-dl", line 2
    SyntaxError: Non-ASCII character '\x93' ...

means you're using an outdated version of Python. Please update to
Python 2.6 or 2.7.

What is this binary file? Where has the code gone?

Since June 2012 (#342) youtube-dl is packed as an executable zipfile,
simply unzip it (might need renaming to youtube-dl.zip first on some
systems) or clone the git repository, as laid out above. If you modify
the code, you can run it by executing the __main__.py file. To recompile
the executable, run make youtube-dl.

The exe throws a Runtime error from Visual C++

To run the exe you need to install first the Microsoft Visual C++ 2008
Redistributable Package.

DEVELOPER INSTRUCTIONS
======================

Most users do not need to build youtube-dl and can download the builds
or get them from their distribution.

To run youtube-dl as a developer, you don't need to build anything
either. Simply execute

    python -m youtube_dl

To run the test, simply invoke your favorite test runner, or execute a
test file directly; any of the following work:

    python -m unittest discover
    python test/test_download.py
    nosetests

If you want to create a build of youtube-dl yourself, you'll need

-   python
-   make
-   pandoc
-   zip
-   nosetests

Adding support for a new site

If you want to add support for a new site, you can follow this quick
list (assuming your service is called yourextractor):

1.  Fork this repository
2.  Check out the source code with
    git clone git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/youtube-dl.git
3.  Start a new git branch with
    cd youtube-dl; git checkout -b yourextractor
4.  Start with this simple template and save it to
    youtube_dl/extractor/yourextractor.py:

        # coding: utf-8
        from __future__ import unicode_literals

        import re

        from .common import InfoExtractor


        class YourExtractorIE(InfoExtractor):
            _VALID_URL = r'https?://(?:www\.)?yourextractor\.com/watch/(?P<id>[0-9]+)'
            _TEST = {
                'url': 'http://yourextractor.com/watch/42',
                'md5': 'TODO: md5 sum of the first 10KiB of the video file',
                'info_dict': {
                    'id': '42',
                    'ext': 'mp4',
                    'title': 'Video title goes here',
                    # TODO more properties, either as:
                    # * A value
                    # * MD5 checksum; start the string with md5:
                    # * A regular expression; start the string with re:
                    # * Any Python type (for example int or float)
                }
            }

            def _real_extract(self, url):
                mobj = re.match(self._VALID_URL, url)
                video_id = mobj.group('id')

                # TODO more code goes here, for example ...
                webpage = self._download_webpage(url, video_id)
                title = self._html_search_regex(r'<h1>(.*?)</h1>', webpage, 'title')

                return {
                    'id': video_id,
                    'title': title,
                    # TODO more properties (see youtube_dl/extractor/common.py)
                }

5.  Add an import in youtube_dl/extractor/__init__.py.
6.  Run python test/test_download.py TestDownload.test_YourExtractor.
    This should fail at first, but you can continually re-run it until
    you're done.
7.  Have a look at youtube_dl/common/extractor/common.py for possible
    helper methods and a detailed description of what your extractor
    should return. Add tests and code for as many as you want.
8.  If you can, check the code with pyflakes (a good idea) and pep8
    (optional, ignore E501).
9.  When the tests pass, add the new files and commit them and push the
    result, like this:

        $ git add youtube_dl/extractor/__init__.py
        $ git add youtube_dl/extractor/yourextractor.py
        $ git commit -m '[yourextractor] Add new extractor'
        $ git push origin yourextractor

10. Finally, create a pull request. We'll then review and merge it.

In any case, thank you very much for your contributions!

BUGS
====

Bugs and suggestions should be reported at:
https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/issues . Unless you were prompted so
or there is another pertinent reason (e.g. GitHub fails to accept the
bug report), please do not send bug reports via personal email.

Please include the full output of the command when run with --verbose.
The output (including the first lines) contain important debugging
information. Issues without the full output are often not reproducible
and therefore do not get solved in short order, if ever.

For discussions, join us in the irc channel #youtube-dl on freenode.

When you submit a request, please re-read it once to avoid a couple of
mistakes (you can and should use this as a checklist):

Is the description of the issue itself sufficient?

We often get issue reports that we cannot really decipher. While in most
cases we eventually get the required information after asking back
multiple times, this poses an unnecessary drain on our resources. Many
contributors, including myself, are also not native speakers, so we may
misread some parts.

So please elaborate on what feature you are requesting, or what bug you
want to be fixed. Make sure that it's obvious

-   What the problem is
-   How it could be fixed
-   How your proposed solution would look like

If your report is shorter than two lines, it is almost certainly missing
some of these, which makes it hard for us to respond to it. We're often
too polite to close the issue outright, but the missing info makes
misinterpretation likely. As a commiter myself, I often get frustrated
by these issues, since the only possible way for me to move forward on
them is to ask for clarification over and over.

For bug reports, this means that your report should contain the complete
output of youtube-dl when called with the -v flag. The error message you
get for (most) bugs even says so, but you would not believe how many of
our bug reports do not contain this information.

Site support requests must contain an example URL. An example URL is a
URL you might want to download, like
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaW_jenozKc . There should be an obvious
video present. Except under very special circumstances, the main page of
a video service (e.g. http://www.youtube.com/ ) is not an example URL.

Are you using the latest version?

Before reporting any issue, type youtube-dl -U. This should report that
you're up-to-date. About 20% of the reports we receive are already
fixed, but people are using outdated versions. This goes for feature
requests as well.

Is the issue already documented?

Make sure that someone has not already opened the issue you're trying to
open. Search at the top of the window or at
https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/search?type=Issues . If there is an
issue, feel free to write something along the lines of "This affects me
as well, with version 2015.01.01. Here is some more information on the
issue: ...". While some issues may be old, a new post into them often
spurs rapid activity.

Why are existing options not enough?

Before requesting a new feature, please have a quick peek at the list of
supported options. Many feature requests are for features that actually
exist already! Please, absolutely do show off your work in the issue
report and detail how the existing similar options do not solve your
problem.

Is there enough context in your bug report?

People want to solve problems, and often think they do us a favor by
breaking down their larger problems (e.g. wanting to skip already
downloaded files) to a specific request (e.g. requesting us to look
whether the file exists before downloading the info page). However, what
often happens is that they break down the problem into two steps: One
simple, and one impossible (or extremely complicated one).

We are then presented with a very complicated request when the original
problem could be solved far easier, e.g. by recording the downloaded
video IDs in a separate file. To avoid this, you must include the
greater context where it is non-obvious. In particular, every feature
request that does not consist of adding support for a new site should
contain a use case scenario that explains in what situation the missing
feature would be useful.

Does the issue involve one problem, and one problem only?

Some of our users seem to think there is a limit of issues they can or
should open. There is no limit of issues they can or should open. While
it may seem appealing to be able to dump all your issues into one
ticket, that means that someone who solves one of your issues cannot
mark the issue as closed. Typically, reporting a bunch of issues leads
to the ticket lingering since nobody wants to attack that behemoth,
until someone mercifully splits the issue into multiple ones.

In particular, every site support request issue should only pertain to
services at one site (generally under a common domain, but always using
the same backend technology). Do not request support for vimeo user
videos, Whitehouse podcasts, and Google Plus pages in the same issue.
Also, make sure that you don't post bug reports alongside feature
requests. As a rule of thumb, a feature request does not include outputs
of youtube-dl that are not immediately related to the feature at hand.
Do not post reports of a network error alongside the request for a new
video service.

Is anyone going to need the feature?

Only post features that you (or an incapicated friend you can personally
talk to) require. Do not post features because they seem like a good
idea. If they are really useful, they will be requested by someone who
requires them.

Is your question about youtube-dl?

It may sound strange, but some bug reports we receive are completely
unrelated to youtube-dl and relate to a different or even the reporter's
own application. Please make sure that you are actually using
youtube-dl. If you are using a UI for youtube-dl, report the bug to the
maintainer of the actual application providing the UI. On the other
hand, if your UI for youtube-dl fails in some way you believe is related
to youtube-dl, by all means, go ahead and report the bug.
